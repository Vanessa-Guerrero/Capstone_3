# Capstone_3

Final Capstone for Data Analysis LTCA. 

Used a sample data of a virtual student bookstore called EmporiUm and used PowerBI to clean data through Power Query (M lanaguage) and create analyzations with DaX. 
After completing those steps, I created a report with visualizations detailing stores sale trends for the South Region - South Carolina, Florida, Texas and comparing them to online sales.
